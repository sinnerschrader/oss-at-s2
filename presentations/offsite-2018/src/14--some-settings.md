## Some settings to take care of

---

Give yourself a _public name_.

---

It would be lovely if this would be your **real name** ðŸ˜‰

---

Open your settings ...

Do you want others to see that you're **part of the SinnerSchrader Organization**?

^ There is also the question if you want others to see that you're part of the SinnerSchrader Organization.

---

Because: **Default is private!**

---

Go to our Organization

_github.com/sinnerschrader_

---

Open the _people_ tab
