## [fit] What should I
# [fit] **take care of**?

^ @Martin: Here are some suggestions on what you can add to your repository (next slide)

---

# [fit] CONTRIBUTION.md

^ @Martin: A good contribution.md contains information (next slide)

---

How the **project setup** works.

^ @Martin

---

How to **report issues**.

^ @Martin

---

How **others** can contribute at all.

^ @Martin

---

Therefore what contribution **would you like** ...

^ @Martin

---

... and what **not**?

^ @Martin: This is important to help others get into your project.
And to be possible at all to contribute.
As well as ... (next slide)

---

## [fit] Write a good
# [fit] **README.md**

^ @Martin: ... and link to the contribution.md and other important files.

---

We also provided an **example** for you:

_github.com/sinnerschrader/oss-at-s2#readme_

^ @Martin: There you can find how a basic readme could look like.

---

# CodeOfConduct

^ @Martin: Is something that should not be missing.

---

A good starting point:

_contributor-covenant.org_

^ @Martin: Here they provide a CodeOfConduct in different formats ready to use.
Using these is better than using none.
They also provide versioning if changes appear.
Another important thing (next slide)

---

# LICENSE.md

^ @Martin: At least a basic one like the well known MIT license.

---

A range of OSS licenses:

_github.com/sinnerschrader/oss-at-s2#license_

^ @Martin: Again, in our repository we provide examples for some good OSS license.
For example this presentation uses the MIT license (next slide).
