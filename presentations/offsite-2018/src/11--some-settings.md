Follow further instructions ðŸ˜Ž

Give yourself a _public name_.

^ @Martin: But there is more.

It would be lovely if this would be your **real name** ðŸ˜‰

^ @Martin: Or your first name with one letter surname or some like that.

Again, open your settings ...

Do you want others to see that you're **part of the SinnerSchrader Organization**?

Go to our Organization

^ @Martin

---

Open the _people_ tab
